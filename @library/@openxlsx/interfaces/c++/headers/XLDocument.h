     *
     * @details This class encapsulates the concept of an Excel file. It is different from the XLWorkbook, in that an
     * XLDocument holds an XLWorkbook together with its metadata, as well as methods for opening,
     * closing and saving the document.
     *
     * ### Usage ###
     * Using the member functions of this class, Excel files can be created, and existing files can be opened. An object
     * of the XLDocument class functions as an opaque pointer. I.e. objects can be copied and moved around, but each copy
     * will still operate on the same document. Internally, it works by having a std::shared_ptr to an implementation
     * object. When the last XLDocument object (pointing to the same implementation object) is destroyed or goes out of
     * scope, the implementation object and any child objects will be destroyed as well.
     *
     * ### Example ###
     *
     * ```cpp
     * XLDocument doc;
     * doc.CreateDocument("./MyTest.xlsx");
     *
     * XLDocument copy = doc; //copy and doc points to the same object!
     * copy.Save();
     * ```
     *
     * @todo Implement a Clone method. Ensure that the source object is not modified in any way, including saving to disk.
